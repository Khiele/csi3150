    <p>My name is Kyle Trevor Unger. I am a senior undergraduate at Oakland Univeristy majoring in a Bachelors Degree
        for Information techniology.
        I am from Chesterfield Township in Macomb County and I commute full time to Oakland whilst working part time. I
        currently work as a shift manager
        at a Wendys while I pursue my higher education, but for a time I worked two jobs. I worked as a warehouse
        associate with
        BestBuy in order to better help fund my education.
        I am a passionate individual with an ambition to start a career in computer science engineering. I aspire to
        learn as many techniologies and professional skills
        as possible within the duration of my education and onwards; however, I have a focus on learning Cyber Security
        as a profession.
